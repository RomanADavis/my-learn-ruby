The original tests, which I have only edited slightly in the case of the calculator spec,
are not mine originally and to the best of my knowledge were created by Test First. The
methods I made to pass the tests are in the same folder as the tests, since that's what
makes sense to me.

9/19/2014 - Added solutions for 1-9, including solutions to pass calculator tests that
I implemented as an optional exercise. May add more in the future, but don't count on it.
